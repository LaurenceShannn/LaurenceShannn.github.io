                <p>I am Shan Laurence S. Mojica, an 18-year-old first-year student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology at Quezon City University. While I presently reside in Quezon City, my roots are in Kawit, Cavite. My background includes photography, which began as "phonetography" between 2020 and 2023 and became a professional practice upon acquiring my own camera in 2023, now serving as both a committed hobby and a freelance job.</p>

                        <h4>About Me</h4>
                        <p>I am a determined creative photographer who finds growth on the road, capturing inspiring places and infusing those images with deep purpose and meaning. My work is designed to motivate and fuel adventure in others, as I am always striving to evolve in my own unique way.</p>

                        <h4>About the Portfolio</h4>
                        <p>My portfolio serves two essential purposes: First, my main goal is to show my ability to produce high-quality photos that possess deep narrative meaning and successfully portray the genuine emotions of my subjects. Second, I have included a complete professional overview, giving you detailed information about me, a curated list of my completed projects, and all my necessary contact information for collaboration and booking.</p>
